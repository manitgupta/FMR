# FMR

We were asked to develop an online Resource Management Portal (RMS) which stored
the data of First Medical Responders (FMRâ€™s) from 14 states and their respective
districts. The website must provide a simple way to view, update and delete
information about FMRs. Access must be provided to National, State and District Level
users by individual logins based on clearance levels. Finally, it must provide a method
to the National Headquarters to contact all FMRs of a state or to a state to contact all
the FMRs from various districts of the state at once via E-mail.
